/**
 * The `UserRepository` interface defines the operations that can be performed on user data within the application.
 * Utilizing an interface for the UserRepository provides several advantages:
 *
 * - **Abstraction**: The `UserRepository` interface abstracts the details of data access implementations from the rest of the application.
 *   This means that the underlying data access mechanism (e.g., local database, remote API) can change, but the rest of the application
 *   remains unaffected because it interacts with this interface, not directly with the implementation.
 *
 * - **Testing**: Interfaces make unit testing and integration testing easier. Mock implementations of the `UserRepository` can be
 *   created to test other parts of the application without requiring access to a real database or network.
 *
 * - **Flexibility**: It allows for multiple implementations of the UserRepository. For example, an application might initially
 *   retrieve user data from a local database but later needs to switch to a remote API. This change can be easily accommodated
 *   by providing a new implementation of the `UserRepository` interface.
 *
 * - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Adhering to this principle from SOLID principles, the `UserRepository` interface
 *   helps in inverting the dependency. Higher-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules but should depend on abstractions.
 *   This principle enhances the modularity and extensibility of the application.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for managing user data, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.
